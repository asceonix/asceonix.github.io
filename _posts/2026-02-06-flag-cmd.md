title: "Challenge — FLAG CMD"
---

## Overview

This challenge was focused on observing how a web application exposes data through its network requests. The goal was to identify hidden information and use it correctly to retrieve the flag.

---

## Initial Analysis

After starting the challenge, I inspected the webpage using the browser’s developer tools. At first glance, the page looked simple, with only a few visible fields and minimal interaction.

I moved to the **Network** tab to see how the page was communicating with the backend. Initially, the requests were limited, so I refreshed the page to ensure all background requests were captured.

## Finding the Key Detail

After refreshing, a request named **`options`** appeared in the Network tab. Opening this request and checking the **Response** section revealed something interesting.

The response contained a field named **`secrets`**.

Inside this field was the following value:

> *“Blip-blop, in a pickle with a hiccup! Shmiggity-shmack”*

This immediately stood out, as it looked intentionally hidden and not meant to be visible through the normal interface.

## Exploitation Logic

The application was trusting that users wouldn’t inspect or directly use data exposed through background requests. By copying the value found in the `secrets` field and submitting it back through the webpage, the application accepted it and revealed the flag.

---

## Result

The flag was successfully obtained by identifying and using hidden data exposed through the network response.

## Lessons Learned

- Always inspect network requests, even for simple pages  
- Refreshing the page can reveal additional backend interactions  
- Sensitive data exposed in responses can often be directly abused  
- Logic flaws are often about **trust**, not complex exploits
